# Salary Scrapy 
This project crawls through Glassdoor and analyzes the salaries per profession and country
that are provided in ``static_files/``

# Crawler
The first part is the crawler. The salaryscraper crawls through specific urls to download the data as seen below:

``` 
{
     'country_currency': 'EUR',
     'job_median_payment': '1298',
     'job_percentile10_payment': '869',
     'job_percentile90_payment': '2434',
     'job_title': 'Data Scientist',
     'location': 'Athens, Attica',
     'sample_size': '56'
 }
 ```

# DynamoDB
This project uses a connection to AWS DynamoDB to store the data in.
   1. Create a new table called "glassdoor" in DynamoDB & Set partition key to be the timestamp column 
   2. Go in IAM and create a new User group and under attach permissions policies use only "AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess" 
   also create a user and add him to that group
   3. The above steps will also give you the Access key ID & Secret key access that is needed in order to host this in Heroku
   add those in environment variables in Heroku and also add in your glassdoor username & password to authenticate the session
   4. The pipeline that stores the data in herokuDB along with the connection initialization is in `pipelines.py`
   5. Create the table with the correct name in DynamoDB, set partition key to "timestamp"

# Scrapy & Heroku & Flask 
   1. The ```glassdoor_spider``` scrapes the data by creating the URLs based on the information in the static_files
   2. Scraping in Heroku is not allowed so proxies should be used instead (`salaryscrape/settings.py`) and that makes the process slower
   to make this faster, hit an API with valid proxies instead of a static list
   3. The ```pipelines.py``` store each parsed item into the dynamodb table

# Scheduler
   1. When we post a request at ```/crawl```, the spider is triggered and then the scheduler takes over to keep triggering it 
   2. The crawling is scheduled once every 2 weeks to get up-to-date date plus gather historical data

# TODO: 
1. Add in Streamlit UI (?)
2. Unit tests 
3. Add circleci for 1) linting 2) black lib 3) unit tests
